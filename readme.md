# GW2-API

Proxy-layer for the official GW2 item, tradingpost and render API (or: yet another gw2spidy)

## Reference

Please visit the homepage for endpoint references: http://gw2-api.com

## Why?

This code is mainly used as the tradingpost backend for gw2efficiency.com because I was not satisfied
with the existing solutions (mainly because of cache time, update frequency and data format)
